Seong Gi-hun is down on his luck and has enormous debts with loan sharks. While at a train station, he’s asked by a well-dressed man to play a game of ddakji, where if he wins a round he’ll get 100,000 won, but if he loses then the man will slap his face. After playing, the man gives Gi-hun a card, inviting him to play games with higher stakes. Gi-hun accepts and is taken, while unconscious, to a mysterious location with 455 other players who awaken in a dorm and are identified by numbers on their clothes. The location is managed by masked staff, and overseen by the Front Man, also masked. The players are all in similarly dire financial straits and will be given billions of won in prize money if they win six games over six days. Gi-hun befriends Player 001, an elderly man, and recognizes among the players Cho Sang-woo, a former classmate and businessman, and Player 067, a pickpocket who once stole his money. The first game is Red Light, Green Light where those who lose are gunned down on the spot. Gi-hun, though terrified, is encouraged by Sang-woo to play, and is saved from falling by Player 199. All three are able to complete the game.

[man] In my town, we had a game called the “Squid Game.”

We called it that because it’s played in a court shaped like a squid.

The rules are simple.

Children are divided into two groups, the offense and the defense.

Once the game starts, the defense can run around on two feet within bounds,

while the offense outside the lines are only allowed to hop on one foot.

It’s your mom.

[man] But if an attacker cuts through the waist of the squid passing defense,

then they are given freedom to use both feet.

[playful music]

Inspector royal.

[man] Inspector royal.

For whatever reason, we called that the inspector royal.

When we were ready for the final battle,

all the attackers gathered at the entrance to the squid.

Go.

[man] In order to win,

the attackers must tap the small closed-off space

on the squid’s head with their foot.

But if someone on the defense manages to push you

outside of the squid’s boundaries,

you die.

That’s right. You die.

[playful music continues]

[shirt tearing]

[playful music]

[playful music rising]

Victory!

[kids cheering]

[man] Victory.

Once you tap the squid’s head, you win and yell out, “Victory.”

At that moment, I felt as if I owned the entire world,

exhilarated.

[woman] Ah.

Um…

Is this my daily allowance or what?

No. Remember, Ga-yeong’s birthday is today?

[sighs]

Yeah. Of course, I do.

[woman] And don’t forget, go and get her, uh, something for dinner later.

Well, I can’t buy her a nice meal with these much. Times are tough.

Ga-yeong loves fried chicken, you know.

Go buy her some fried chicken.

Just chicken, Mom?

Don’t you think I should get a present for her?

Give me some more, huh?

[woman grunts] I’m broke.

[man] What are you talking about?

I gave you everything I made chauffeuring.

Oh, please, that petty change?

Hey, we can’t even pay your loan’s monthly interest off with that.

[woman grunts]

We can’t do that now, and we barely spend anything.

[grunts]

Let’s use some when we have to.

[woman] Goodness.

Oh.

[woman groans]

And will you stop working so much?

Her birthday.

Um, uh…

You’re telling me you don’t know your own mother’s birthday?

Any kid knows that.

Hey!

Don’t say that. I do know.

Hey.

She celebrates it going by the lunar date, meaning it’s not the same every year.

Ah. [chuckles]

Oh, plus, it’s a lighter. [laughs]

Looks like the real deal, doesn’t it? [chuckles]

[laughs awkwardly]

I think you’ll get in trouble with Mom again

if she saw me holding this.

Is that right?

I’ll keep it then, just till you get a little bit older. Okay?

Hey, don’t smoke of it, though.

Oh, come on, I’m clean now.

All right. All right.

I’ll make sure I’ll stop smoking for real.

And you’ll see next year, huh, I’ll get an awesome present for you, okay?

Ga-yeong, I swear.

Next year?

Last year, you had a birthday.

This one came right around, right?

And the next one will be quick.

Um, Dad?

Hmm? Shoot.

Nothing. [nervous chuckle]

Okay. Come on, come on. Have more tteokbokki.

Excuse me, sir, one more order, okay?

And mix it with some of that in.

[sighs]

[Ga-yeong’s mom] Why did you bring her back so late?

She’s not dressed for the cold.

Oh, she got sleepy, I carried her.

We’re ten minutes late at most. Okay?

I said I’d drive down to get her, didn’t I?

It’s her birthday. Let’s not yell.

[Ga-yeong] Mom.

Oh.

Hey, Ga-yeong, hey, get down.

I’ll carry her to the elevator if you don’t mind, okay?

You people have all kinds of tactics.

And I know you’re only doing your job, but I really don’t have time to sit here…

I’m sure you’ve played ddakji before, right?

Play a few round of ddakji with me.

And each time you win, I’ll pay you a 100,000 won.

[Gi-hun scoffs]

Wait, so if I hit your ddakji, and it flips over,

I get a 100,000 won?

And if I can flip yours, you will give me the exact same amount of money.

You can also be the first to play.

Hey, look, I had a bad day today.

You pull a scam or you rip me off, well, then, I’ll… I’ll kill you, huh?

So then it’s my turn, eh?

So which color do you wanna play as?

[grunts]

[frustrated grunt] Shh…

Well, what’s wrong?

So the thing is…

How about you use your body to pay?

A what? [grunts]

Next year?

The US?

That’s right.

Her stepdad’s job begins soon and needs him to go.

So the entire family is going to move there.

I see.

You hear me? How can you eat anything right now, huh?

You need to get your daughter to stay here.

And how do I do that?

We’re done. We settled that when we agreed to the divorce.

[sighs]

I talked to that young man upstairs who knows the law,

and he said that the father has to show the child

will have financial support, and when you can prove that…

then you can take custody. Huh?

If she moves to the US, you know what will happen?

She’ll forget how to speak Korean.

She won’t be able to talk to you like she can right now.

You’re going to become a stranger to her.

[man] Hello. Who’s calling?

Hello.

You gave me your business card earlier.

Do you wish to participate in the game?

If you wish to participate, please state your name and birthdate.

[man] Mr. Seong Gi-hun?

Uh, yeah.

Password?

Red light, green light. That’s the password.

[Gi-hun] Ah…

[sighs]

I guess everyone is…

pretty tired. Um…

How long will it take to get to the…

game venue or whatever?

[upbeat classical music rises]

[upbeat classical music continues]

[man 1] Fifty… Fifty-two…

What the…

Fifty-five, fifty-six.

Excuse me, sir.

And then, there are those…

What are you doing?

Stop talking to me or I lose count.

And so I was at 50, so the…

Ah, you must be trying to count how many of us there are, is that right?

That’s right. So could you stop talking to me for a while?

And then… Huh?

Hold on.

Where was I just then?

Up on the board, sir. There are 456 here.

[man 1 clears throat]

Oh. Look, that means you were given the number one.

And I’m… Oh.

I’m the last.

[chuckles]

I know all that too.

I’m just counting the numbers.

My doctor said counting is good so I don’t get dementia or anything.

If dementia’s a concern for you, then what are you doing here?

I think you’d wanna stay at home,

let your daughter-in-law cook your meals for you.

Go sit on a coffee chair somewhere.

And look at your grandkids, I think.

You think so?

What about both of your parents?

Do they get nice food cooked by their daughter-in-law all day long?

[man 1 sighs, coughs]

I don’t have much time left now.

Huh?

The doctor said there’s a…

a lump inside over here. Growing every day.

Your… your head?

Brain tumor.

[chuckles]

[man 2] You little shit!

[man 3] Stop them!

[background chatter]

[man 2 laughs]

[panting]

Hey!

Wow.

It really is a small world, huh!

Look at those eyes. You still have that temper, huh.

Then again…

nobody broke your spirit, you could always take a hit.

I took care of you,

I fed you, I taught you when you had nowhere else.

This is what I get?

You took more from me than whatever I might possibly owe.

If all of that’s true, how come you ran then?

Well, I didn’t. I went independent.

Hmm. [cackles]

“Independent”?

[sighs]

[crowd gasps]

[crowd exclaims]

[both grunt]

[man 2 grunts]

[crowd exclaims]

[crowd gasps]

[background chatter]

[woman grunts]

[man 2] Independent, huh? Are you some kind of activist?

Come on then, go wave a flag.

Oh, that’s right.

You’re from North Korea, huh? Then wave theirs. Hmm?

Damn you! [grunts]

[woman groans]

Hey, you come here. Hold still.

Oh. That scar on your neck.

You’re the damn pickpocket! You loser.

My money, give it back. Where is it?

You took it. I need it… Ah!

[crowd gasps]

[Gi-hun] What the hell?

Who are you?

Uh…

What do you think you’re doing?

Me? Uh, well… Look.

The name’s Seong Gi-hun. I live in Ssangmun-dong.

Hey, Ssangmun-dong shit.

Yeah?

This little bitch and I weren’t done talking.

Yeah, I understand that. It’s just there’s something that me and this…

woman should talk about urgently.

[sighs]

[man 2] You bastard!

What scheme are you two running?

[mocking laugh] You’re asking me?

What’s your problem with this girl, 101?

Yeah, I’ll bet that, that you’re a thug who preys on girls

that takes advantage of them.

Did you tell her to rob me like that?

You little son of a bitch!

Get away! Hey!

[crowd gasps]

Hey, he wants to hit me.

This thug is trying to hit me, huh!

Hey, somebody get over here! We need help!

[alarm buzzes]

Oh! Oh, there they are!

Over here. She’ll pick all our pockets, sir.

[clattering]

Him too. They’ll pick, they’ll pick…

[breathing heavily]

[enigmatic music]

[breathing heavily]

[masked manager] I would like to extend a heartfelt welcome to you all.

Everyone here will participate in six different games over six days.

Those who win all six games will receive a handsome cash prize.

[man 3] And why should we believe that?

Y-You took all our stuff and put us to sleep coming here,

and then you brought us to this strange warehouse.

Now you’re saying you’ll pay us if we go and play a few games?

You really expect us to buy that?

[masked manager] We reluctantly took all of those measures

to maintain confidentiality as we brought you here.

We’ll return everything once the games are over.

You all… you all have masks. Why are you wearing those things?

[masked manager] We do not disclose the faces

and personal information of our staff to any of the participants.

It’s a measure we take to ensure fair games and confidentiality.

Please understand.

Well, I don’t believe you one bit. You got that?

You tricked us. We were kidnapped.

You can make as many excuses as you want

to make sure nobody knows you broke the law in here.

If you’re going to make up for that, then we’re gonna need something more.

[masked manager] Player 218, Cho Sang-woo.

[beeps]

[lights click]

Age, 46 years.

Former team leader of Team Two at Joy Investments.

Siphoned money off from his clients’ balances,

then invested it in derivatives and futures options and failed.

Current loss, 650 million won.

107, Kim Mi-ok, 540 million in debt.

118, Oh Yeong-uk, 1.02 billion in debt.

322, Jung Min-tae, 880 million in debt.

119, No Sang-hun, 1.39 billion in debt.

369, Park Ju-un, 900 million in debt.

Every person standing here in this room is living on the brink of financial ruin.

You all have debts that you can’t pay off.

When we first went to see each of you, not a single one of you trusted us.

But as you all know, we played a game,

and as we promised, gave you money when you won.

And suddenly, everyone here trusted us.

You called and volunteered to participate in this game of your own free will.

So this is it.

I’ll give you one last chance to choose.

Will you go back to living your old and depressing lives

getting chased by your creditors?

Or will you act and seize this last opportunity we’re offering here?

[all murmuring]

Hey! Which games are we playing here?

[masked manager] In order to play fair,

we cannot disclose any information about the games ahead of time.

[Gi-hun] One question.

If we win, just how much do we get?

[remote beeps]

[top door opening]

[quirky music]

[masked manager] Your prize money will be accumulated in there after every game.

We will disclose the amount to everyone after the first game is over.

If you do not wish to participate, then please let us know at this time.

What happened? What the hell are you doing here?

Uh, your mother and I were talking the other day.

She told you were out of the country on a business trip.

What was that guy talking about, huh?

You can’t be in debt?

The same Sang-woo who attends SNU, right?

[woman on PA] Attention, all players.

After you enter the game hall…

We’ll talk about it later.

…please stand behind the white line drawn on the field

Hey.

Huh?

What’s that? Over there.

[Player 324] Looks really freaky.

[Player 250] Damn, that thing has a freaking huge head.

[both laugh]

[woman on PA] Here is the first game.

You will be playing Red Light, Green Light.

[doll whirring]

You are allowed to move forward when “it” shouts out, “Green Light,”

stop when “it” shouts, “Red Light.”

If your movement is detected afterward, you will be eliminated.

Red Light, Green Light?

The thing we did as kids in the playground?

[woman on PA] Let me repeat the rule.

I think that’s what she said.

[Player 250] Red Light, Green Light?

Is this a joke?

[woman on PA] You’re allowed to move…

Do you think they’re serious?

…when “it” shouts out, “Green Light.”

Well then, bet on the first one there?

Stop when “it” shouts, “Red Light.”

If your movement is detected afterward,

you will be eliminated.

A million won.

Deal?

[cackles] Goddamn it.

You’re on!

[woman on PA] Those players who cross the finish line

without being eliminated within the five-minute playtime

will pass this round.

With that, let the game begin.
